# AHPilotStats
=======
A pilot statistics application for Hitech Creation's Aces High MMOG. It screen-scrapes the scores and stats pages from hitechcreations.com to download and store pilot statistics and offer multiple views of that data.

## What is it
An application i built in C#.Net Windows Forms over 10 years ago when i actively played Aces High. It is no longer under active development. I have put it on Github so that others who are interested can fork it and extended it as they see fit.
