Version:
1.7.0 (Public/Only Version) [25-MAR-2010]
===========================================
1. Altered the way tour definitions are transformed, mapped, and used
   to be more flexible when/if HTC add new tour types (eg the WW1 Arena).
   This changes the tourdefinitions.xslt XSLT transform doc, the stats 
   service, and the stats app.
   * Note: This fixes the load errors that were seen since AH 2.18 was released.
2. Added a new update check on application boot. Notifies users of a more recent version
   than they are currently running.
3. Fixed a bug in the Obj v Obj tab where switching between the group-by clauses did not cause
   a refresh.
4. Added Column filtering to all tables except obj v obj grid (which already had it sort of).
5. Added start up tips.
6. Added donation consideration message in the application status strip.
   

1.6.0 (Public/Only Version) [21-APR-2009]
===========================================
1. Changed the logic for assembling composite squad data. The squad members now no longer
   need to be 'in sync' with each other. The squad page will now simply display the composite
   of the data it has loaded. The onus is now on the user to ensure they keep the stats of the
   contributing members of their squads up to date. The app will no longer attempt to warn/stop
   if they are not.
2. Brought the app up to speed with the new HTC stats pages after they were unified with the 
   new(ish) scores pages. Removed all the extra code and leg-work needed to keep a list of
   'legacy' tour meta data for the loading of stats. Now the stats loader can leverage the 
   meta data the scores loader uses. 
3. Altered the loader to use only one loader thread which now loads scores and then stats in sequence
   5 seconds apart from each other.
4. Fixed a bug where the loader were supposed to wait 5 seconds between calls if loading multiple
   pilot/tours in one go and they didnt. Loader now waits 5 seconds as it should have all along.
5. Fixed a bug where if a stats object failed to load then it would crash the app under some circum-
   stances. Now it will just warn the user if data is missing.
6. Fixed a bug in the life-time management of the Registry object. It was always intended to fully load
   the stats at app start-up, however it never did and only loaded on demand. Now it does.
   
1.5.4 (Public/Only Version) [15th Nov 2008]
===========================================
1. Fixed a bug (introduced in 1.5.3) which stopped the application from displaying a pilot's 
   statistics if you had no AKUAG sqaud defined. 

1.5.3 (Public/Only Version) [5th Oct 2008]
==========================================
1. Fixed a bug where in the Obj Vs Obj tab, the All Tours selection counted the first
   tour's data twice. Thanks to Lusche/Snailman for pointing this out.
2. Fixed a minor bug on the loader screen.


1.5.2 (Public/Only Version) [10 July 2008]
==========================================
1. Added a new "Tour" column and made the grids sorted by tour number only. This fixes
   the apparent tour sort order bug for tours over 100. The new "Tour" column displays
   only the tour number. The old "Tour" column is renamed to "Tour Details".
2. Rebranded the old AKUAG icons with the new one.


1.5.1 (Public/Only Version) [16 March 2008]
============================================
1. Made the stats/scores pages URLs configurable by way of the app.config file. 
   This should make handling any URL changes easier in the future (eg only a 
   config file patch, not a binary re-release). Should really have done this ages
   ago, but i'm a slack bastard.
2. Added the new server name to the stats/scores pages to fix the fault of loader
   failing since HTC relocated/renamed their score and BB servers for the BB upgrade.
3. Fixed the totals columns on the Obj v Obj page so you can actually see them - duh...
 

1.5.0 (Public/Only Version) [11 October 2007]
============================================
1. Changed the Data loader to force download the HTC tour definitions 
   during its initialisation, rather than during the first data load.
   This means that the user can now only select valid tour type/tour 
   number combinations. 
2. You now filter the graphs page to only graph one tour type at a time. Theres
   no point showing a graph containg AVA tour data in the same graph as say a MWMainArenaTour
   etc. This is really a bug fix...
3. Altered the way errors are reported to the user during load.
4. The loader threads no longer write the files directly as they load. They are now assigned
   to a list in the thread parameter which is marshalled back to the caller (main) thread
   to do the writing and reporting of errors in one place for logical consistency. IT was possible 
   to write a stats object and no scores object with the old arrangement as each thread didnt know 
   the issues the other encounters. This ensures we write out both scores and stats objects as a 
   logical whole - never one or the other if one errors during load.
5. HTCPilotScoreSvc is now at version 1.4.0 and introduces a new TourDefinitionsLoaderSvc - which
   is called the the data loader form constructor.
6. Changed the interfaces to the Stats and Score Loader Services.
7. Added TourDefinitions to the registry - they only are loaded when they are needed.
8. Fixed a bug with the initial sort orders of the grids.
9. Altered the layout of the loader form, so you choose the tour type before the
   tour start and end numbers. This is because the number range you can select from
   now depend on the tour type selected.
10. Changed the TourListTransform and LegacyTourListTransform XSLT files to 
    switch on the new tour types (LW, EW, MW etc). The XSLT transform pack is now
    at version 1.5	
11. LW Arena tour data will still be called simply "MainArenaTour". EW and MW are 
	called EWMainArena and MWMainArena, respectively, and from Oct 07 start numbering
	from 1 (where LW tours continue from where the old MA tour left off at 93).
	


1.4.0 (Public/Only Version) [12 July 2007]
=========================================
1. App now captures 'Died In' stat for each model. This means i have changed the XSD to 
   add a new optional element 'Died In' (int). The new stat is shown in the Obj Vs Obj
   tab. This also means i've changed the XSLT transform for the stats XML transform.
   1.4.0 is tolerant of old XML stats files without the 'Died In' stat, the column
   in the grid will show as empty and the running totals Died In and Kills/Death will be
   empty. You are urged to reload all your data so that the new features can work properly.
2. Added a new column ('Died In') in the Obj Vs Obj tab.
3. Added a new column ('Kills/Death') in the Obj Vs Obj tab.
4. Added new running totals boxes at the bottom of the Obj Vs Obj grid.
5. The new version (1.4.0) includes the stats service dll version 1.3.0, and XSLT pack ver 1.4.
6. Altered the loader dialog to always capitalise the first letter of the pilot name for consistency.
7. Fixed the bug where you get two entries for the same pilot, if one of the first letters in the 
   stats files filename are different case.
8. Fixed a bug in the define squad form which crashes the app if you use illegal filename characters
   in your squad name. Illegal characters are dropped from the filename.
9. Refactored the CastNumberAndCompareTo() method in my SortableBindingList<T> class.
   


1.3.2 (Public/Only Version) [6th June 2007]
===========================================
1. Fixed a big which crashed the application if you try to download tour 88 stats. This fix
   invloves code changes to the stats loader service assembly (now version 1.2.2) and a new
   XSLT, and a change to an existing XSLT. The new XSLT pack which comes with this new version
   is version 1.3.
   Also added a new feature to the apps menu. It now includes a Help -> News menu which launches
   your web browser and loads the new AKUAG support web page which may be useful to determine
   any issues with the application. I will try keep it up to date so that it contains useful info.
   

1.3.1 (Public/Only Version) [2nd April 2007]
===========================================
1. Fixed a bug in the HTCPilotStatsSvc.dll assembly which causes the app to crash if 
   try download data on days after when the tour is due to end due to the lag in HTC
   rolling over the tours on the next business of the new month. Typically this would
   only affect those who try DL data on the 1st, 2nd and maybe 3rd of a new month
   if HTC hasnt rolled the tours for the new month yet.
   

1.3.0 (Public/Only Version) [28th Feb 2007]
===========================================
1. built new XSLT template for the new HTC scores page, and new XSLT for the existing stats page.
2. Removed all existing limitations from the public version and replaced them with a simple
   timer/Sleep code when doing multi-loads. Now the two loader threads enforce a 10 second sleep 
   after each HTTP call before it does the next in its list. This should stagger the load and slow
   the hits/minute on HTC's web servers to no more than 2 (average) per every ten seconds.
3. Fixed numerous bugs with the squad functionality - now that people may actually use it... 
4. Changed the definition of squad to include start/end tours for each member. 
5. Altered the loader service (now version 1.2.0) to use XSLT 2.0 (Saxon Parser). Now it should be 
   easier to stay up to date with any changes HTC make to their web pages. 
6. Removed the clumbsy HTTPSender assembly - now its all .NET API calls.
7. Added dependency on the SaxonAPI assembly for the XSLT 2.0 parsing.
8. Added a delete pilot functionality. This deletes all xml data files for the nominated pilot in 
   the data folder and forces a registry and menu refresh.
9. Changed the net connection form to me non-modal (never should have been).
10. Added restriction so that only one copy of this app can be run at any one time per PC.

Notes: delete any squad def xml files in your squad subfolder if you have any. Redefine your squad.


1.2.3
=====
Altered the host that the app uses to retrieve the data from since HTC has moved the 
scores pages to a new host.


1.2.2.0
=======
Fixed a bug which crashed the loader since the addition in AHII 2.09 of the F4u-1a.
Made it slightly easier to keep the app up to date when new a/c are added by HTC.
Fixed a sorting bug in the obj v obj grid.
Fixed a defect on the loader form.


1.2.1.0
=======
AHPilotStats.exe 1.2.1 (Public Version) [Built 15th September 2006]
HTCPilotStatsSvc.dll 1.1.1
Fixed issues with the comma decimal seperator for some locales in the HTCPilotStatsSvc.dll
Also fixed a misc bug with the loader form in AHPilotStats.exe


1.2.0.0 (Public version) [Built 10th September 2006]
=================================
The assembly and all its referenced assemblies (except nplot) are now strong-named and signed assemblies. 
This will help limit the re-use of some of this applications parts for potential malicious use.
Addition of release notes in build.
Changed all public modifiers in the HTCPilotStatsSvc assembly to internal, and made AHPilotStats a 
'friend' assembly of it so that only AHPilotStats can access the HTCPilotStatsSvc's methods and members.
Rename the text on data loader form from "Loading Pilot Data - Please Wait..." to 
"Down-loading Pilot Data - Please Wait...".


1.1.2.0 (super-user version) [Built 31th August 2006]
==============================
Same as 1.1.2.0 public, but no restrictions.


1.1.2.0 (Public version) [Built 30th August 2006]
==============================
Numerous bugs corrected. 
The public version is now no longer just a viewer, ive included the download stats functions.
Added limiting features added for the public version: the public version disallows 
downloading an entire sqaudron, disallows downloading of more than one tour per time.


1.1.1.0 (public version) [Built 20th August 2006]
==============================
Public version released.
Public version is only a read-only viewer version only.
Some bug fixes.
